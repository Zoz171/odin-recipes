        <li>3 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups corn oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions :</h2>
    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>Combine 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil; stir until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium; add lime juice. Simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla; let syrup cool.</p>
    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>Stir together vegetable oil, remaining 2 cups water, remaining 1 cup sugar, and salt in a large pot over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium. Add flour all at once; stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until batter forms into a ball. Cook until batter is shiny, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl and cool for about 5 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <p>Flatten batter into the bottom of the bowl. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla; mix until batter is creamy. Pour into a cloth piping bag fitted with a large star tip.</p>
    <h3>Step 4:</h3>
    <p>Heat corn oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat until bubbly; reduce heat to medium-low. Squeeze 2 inches of batter onto an oiled spatula and lower into hot oil; repeat until the saucepan is full. Cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer pastries to a paper bag to drain, about 30 seconds.
